\chapter{Other applications and future work}
\label{chap:applications}

Both \mx and \varan are designed as flexible frameworks which could be extended
to support a variety of application scenarios involving NVX systems. In this
chapter, we discuss four such scenarios: regression testing
(\S\ref{sec:testing}), live sanitization (\S\ref{sec:sanitization}),
record-replay (\S\ref{sec:record_replay}), and security honeypots
(\S\ref{sec:honeypot}). We also present other possible future extensions to
both \mx and \varan.

% \subsubsection{Regression Testing}
% \label{sec:testing}

% One of the most obvious applications of \varan framework is regression testing.
% Developers often made various assumption about their programs. When working on
% a new version, regression testing is often used to ensure that these
% assumptions still hold even in the new version. Unfortunately, testing is not
% an exhaustive technique and since regression tests are often written by the
% same developers as the software itself, there is a high probability that some
% violations will be violated leading to security bugs~\todo{Give concrete
% examples.}.

% Executing the regression suite under \varan while running both versions in
% parallel (possibly even more) might help to reveal the subtle differences,
% otherwise undetected by the tests. Our current prototype can be instructed to
% stop the application when a divergence in the event stream is discovered
% providing a detailed information of the difference (\eg system call and its
% arguments). \varan may also attempt to continue execution performing different
% system calls. However, this may not always be possible (\eg in case of network
% communication), see discussion in \ref{sec:patternmatching} for more details.
