\section{Summary}
\label{evolution:summary}

In this chapter, we have presented a comprehensive study of the evolution of
\numSystems popular open-source systems. We believe the presented results
provide evidence in support of our assumptions. We have shown that:%
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item software patches are small and fairly localized,
\item changes to the external behaviour are infrequent and rather small, and
\item even well tested and fully covered code may contain bugs.
\end{inparaenum}
Furthermore, we have revealed that intercepting sources of non-determinism (\eg
time and date, random number generators or network events) is critically
important for the viability of multi-version execution. The results presented
in this chapter are encouraging for the applicability of our technique.
