\section{Summary}
\label{evolution:summary}

We believe the presented results provides evidence in support of our
assumptions. We have shown that:%
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item many popular open-source projects have insufficient test suite coverage,
\item even well tested and fully covered code may contain bugs, and
\item changes to the external behaviour are sporadic and rather small.
\end{inparaenum}
These results, while rather unwelcome from the general software reliability
perspective, are encouraging for the viability and applicability of our
multi-version execution approach.
