\section{Summary}
\label{evolution:summary}

In this chapter, we have presented a comprehensive study of evolution of
\numSystems popular open-source systems. We believe the presented results
provides evidence in support of our assumptions. We have shown that:%
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item software patches are small and fairly localized,
\item changes to the external behaviour are sporadic and rather small, and
\item even well tested and fully covered code may contain bugs.
\end{inparaenum}
Furthermore, we have revealed that non-determinism is not a problem if we can
intercept sources of non-determinism (\eg time and date, random number
generators or network events). These results are encouraging for the viability
and applicability of the multi-version execution technique.
