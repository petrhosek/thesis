\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{evolution:threats}

The main threat to validity in our study regards the generalisation of our
results.  The patterns we have observed in our data may not generalise to other
systems, or even to other development periods for the same systems.  However,
we regard the selected systems to be representative for open-source C/C++ code,
and the analysis period was chosen in an unbiased way, starting with the
current version at the time of our experiments.

Errors in the software underlying our framework could have interfered with our
experiments. Both Docker and Linux Containers were under development and not
recommended for use in production systems at the time of our study.
Furthermore, in case of some applications, we have observed test failures
caused by the AUFS filesystem used by Docker. However, we have thoroughly
investigated these failures and we believe they did not affect the results
presented in our study. Given the large quantity of data that we collected from
a large number of software revisions, errors in our scripts cannot be excluded.
