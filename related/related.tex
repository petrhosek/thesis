%\subsection{Execution of Multiple Versions}

%The idea of concurrently running multiple versions (or a \emph{multi-version
%execution}) of the same application was first explored in the context of
%$N$-version programming, a software development methodology introduced in the
%seventies in which multiple teams of programmers develop functionally
%equivalent versions of the same program in order to minimise the risk of having
%the same bugs in all versions~\cite{chen1995}. Furthermore, the use of an
%execution environment responsible for running the $N$-version programs and
%choosing one of the outputs was proposed.
  
%This idea has been followed up in~\cite{cox2006}, which proposes the use of
%automatically generated {\it diversified variants} of the same program to
%increase application security. Through the use of multiple variants with
%potentially disjoint exploit sets, the proposed approach makes it difficult to
%exploit a large class of security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow, as
%attackers would need to simultaneously compromise all variants.

%The idea has been implemented in \cite{orchestra09}, which uses a modified
%compiler to produce two versions of the same application with stacks growing in
%opposite directions, together with an execution environment that monitors both
%variants at runtime, checking for any discrepancies in system calls made by the
%variants that would indicate a successful security attack on one of the
%replicas. This work has been further improved in \cite{orchestra11} with new
%method for signal delivery accompanied with detailed analysis of the benchmark
%characteristics. However, their approach is still limited to two versions
%running in lockstep with only difference being the opposite growing stack.
%Most importantly, whenever divergence between the two versions is detected,
%they are immediately stopped.

%The multi-version execution idea has been also used for different purposes ---
%Berger et al. describe a similar approach that uses address space layout
%randomization to generate multiple replicas that are executed
%concurrently~\cite{diehard06}. This approach is combined with randomization
%and replication to provide memory error tolerance. The goal of their work is to
%increase reliability by tolerating memory errors in exchange for space costs
%and execution time.

%Solution described in~\cite{shye2009} runs multiple instances of the same
%version of a single application aiming to overcome transient failures by
%monitoring and comparing their execution on the level of kernel system calls.
%However, this solution does not aim to overcome such failures.

%Running different versions of an application in parallel has also been used to
%test and validate software patches.  In~\cite{onlinevalidation}, two different
%versions of a single application are run in parallel, splitting the execution
%at points where the two versions differ, and comparing their results to test
%the patch for errors and validate its functionality. Whenever one of the two
%versions crashes, a bug is reported. This approach is limited only to a
%specific categories of patches such as refactoring or changes to rarely used
%paths (\eg error handlers). Moreover, this approach is only targeted towards
%on-line validation, not as a generally usable runtime environment.

%Trachsel et al.  use a similar approach to increase performance, where program
%variants are obtained by using different (compiler) optimizations and
%algorithms~\cite{trachsel10}.  The goal is to increase the overall system
%performance by always selecting the variant which finishes its execution first.
%Thereby, no synchronization across variants is needed.

%\subsection{Multi-version Environment and Update Management}

%Closely related to the execution of multiple versions is the management of
%multiple versions, environment and software updates, such as deciding when to
%upgrade, applying updates, \etc

%Solution, which in some sense resembles the multi-version execution idea, has
%been proposed by Michael Franz in~\cite{franz2010} --- instead of executing
%multiple versions in parallel, he proposes to distribute unique version of
%every program to every user. Such versions should be created automatically by
%a ``multicompiler'' and distributed to users through ``App Store''. This would
%increase security as it would be much more difficult to generate attack
%vectors by reverse engineering of security patches for these diversified
%versions.

%To make such a solution work in practice, the way to manage large number of
%different versions and the overall update process is needed. This idea has
%been explored in~\cite{crameri:updates}. This framework integrates upgrade
%deployment, user-machine testing and problem reporting into the overall
%upgrade process.  The framework itself clusters users' machines according to
%their environment, tests the upgrades using cluster representatives and allows
%deployment of complex upgrades.

%Beattie et al. showed in~\cite{beattie2002} that the timing of security patch
%applying can be of critical importance. Patching too early could result in
%breaking the system by applying broken patch, patching too late could on the
%other hand lead to risk of penetration by an attacker exploiting a well known
%security issue. Using the cost functions of corruption and penetration, based
%upon real world empirical data, they have shown that 10 and 30 days after the
%patch's release date are the optimal times to apply the patch to minimize the
%risk of defective patch. Such delay still opens a lot of opportunities for
%potential attackers.

%We believe that our approach can decrease this time virtually to zero
%eliminating the possibility of penetration while retaining the reliability of
%the original version.

%\subsection{Application Sandboxing and Software Fault Isolation}

%Multi-version execution requires some form of application sandboxing and
%software fault isolation. The goal is to isolate the running application from
%underlying system and especially, to prevent software failures from affecting
%the rest of the system including other applications.

%The use of software-based fault isolation for executing untrusted code has
%been described already in~\cite{wahbe1993} for the RISC machines with simple
%instruction set. On the other hand, the first effective implementation of
%software fault isolation for the CISC architecture has been shown much later
%in~\cite{mccamant2006}.

%% Control flow integrity?

%Douceur et. al shown in~\cite{douceur08} how to use sandboxing to enable
%leveraging of existing libraries and programs on the web. To achieve that,
%they used application-level virtualization; their implementation use system
%call mediation together with their own platform abstraction layer to run each
%library or program in so-called \emph{picoprocesses} which can be seen as
%stripped down virtual machine. The biggest downside of this approach is the
%need for code modifications which significantly reduces usability of this
%approach.

%Similar idea has been implemented by Yee et al. in~\cite{nacl} as an
%extension to Google Chrome web browser providing sandbox for untrusted native
%x86 code.  This can be used to develop web applications with performance of
%native applications. Their implementation consists of two parts --- inner
%sandbox which uses lightweight static analysis do detect security defects and
%outer sandbox which mediates system calls. The implementation has been further
%improved in~\cite{sehr2010} with support for ARM and x86-64 architectures and
%recently has been extended in~\cite{ansel2011} by adding support for
%Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation sandboxing. Again, the disadvantage here is the
%need for modifications of existing code and the use of modified GNU compiler
%toolchain to generate compliant binaries.

%Hardware-level virtualization has already been widely adopted in the industry
%for a variety of purposes.  Companies such as VMware or Microsoft provide a
%wide range of virtualization products, while several high-quality open-source
%solutions such as Xen~\cite{xen} also exist.
  
%Operating system-level virtualization is a method which allows to virtualize
%the operating system kernel into multiple isolated partitions (\ie user-space
%instances).  This type of virtualization is provided for different operating
%systems by products such as FreeBSD Jails~\cite{jails}, Linux
%VServer~\cite{vserver} or Solaris Containers~\cite{containers}. Even though
%these solutions are not as widely deployed as those for hardware-level
%virtualization, they are readily available, have lower overhead, and can be
%employed in many real-world scenarios.
  
%We aim to use \emph{application-level virtualization}, which is a lightweight
%variant of operating system-level virtualization, in which applications run in
%independent execution environments.  Even though this area has not been very
%intensively studied, many of its concepts, such as sandboxing, are becoming
%more and more common, especially in the cloud environment.   Some of these
%features are provided by the products such as VMware ThinApp~\cite{thinapp} or
%Microsoft App-V~\cite{appv}.

%Related research utilizing the concepts of application-level virtualization
%has been described in~\cite{yu2006} proposing lightweight virtual machine
%monitor for virtualization of Windows applications. The authors used namespace
%virtualization, implemented at system call level, to achieve isolation of
%resources between individual applications as well host operating system. This
%work has been followed up in~\cite{yu2008} showing three complete application
%benefiting from the approach presented in the original paper.

%More heavyweight, but also more powerful approach was taken by Dike et al.
%in~\cite{dike2001}. Using system call virtualization (via \texttt{ptrace}
%interface) and device abstraction, they managed to port Linux kernel to
%userspace. The resulting implementation runs a Linux virtual machine in a set
%of processes on a Linux host allowing various applications ranging from kernel
%development to application sandboxing and virtualization. Now, this
%implementation has become an optional module of Linux kernel.

%Virtualization approach is also often used in environments with strong
%reliability requirements, especially in the domain of cluster computing. We
%believe that our approach could be used also in these environments. Shown by
%Schroeder et al.  in~\cite{schroeder2007}, around 20\% of all failures at Los
%Alamos National Laboratory are caused by software failures making them a
%second largest contributor after hardware failures. While today's high
%performance computing systems relies mostly on checkpoint-restart schemes to
%achieve fault tolerance, such as the one proposed in~\cite{srinivasan2004}
%further used in~\cite{qin2005}. This approach is often not sufficient, mainly
%due to large decrease in the effective application utilization. Our approach,
%based on multi-version execution inspired by application-level virtualization
%idea, might present a viable alternative to these approaches.
