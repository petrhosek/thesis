\chapter{Efficient Multi-version Execution}

The key component of multi-version execution system is a runtime monitor that
enables the execution of multiple versions in parallel. Unfortunately, existing
monitors impose either a large performance overhead and/or rely on intrusive
kernel-level changes that increase the size of the trusted computing base.
Moreover, none of the existing solutions scales well with the number of
versions, since the runtime monitor acts as a performance bottleneck.

While synchronization can be performed at different levels, the most common
approach is to do it at the level of system calls, for several different
reasons:  first, many patches do not change the the sequence of system calls,
\ie the program's \textit{external behavior} (\S\ref{sec:behavior-evolution}).
%Second, system calls are the main way in which the application communicates
%with the outside environment, and therefore the ultimate target of attackers.
Second, as the main communication mechanism between applications and the
environment, system calls must be virtualized in order to enable the multiple
versions to act as one to the outside world.

%With the widespread availability of multi-core processors, running multiple
%diversified variants or several different versions of an application in
%parallel is becoming a viable approach for increasing software security and
%reliability.  The key component of such N-version execution (NVX) systems is a
%runtime monitor that enables the execution of multiple versions in parallel.

%In this chapter, we introduce \nx, a multi-version execition framework that
%combines binary rewriting with a novel event-streaming architecture to
%significantly reduce performance overhead and scale well with the number of
%versions, without relying on intrusive kernel modifications.

%Our evaluation shows that \nx can be used to run multi-version applications
%based on a number of popular C10k network servers with only a modest
%performance overhead.

The main challenge in implementing a multi-version execution monitor at the
system call level is the trade-off between performance, security, flexibility
and ease of debugging.  Many
implementations~\cite{orchestra09,tachyon12}, including
Mx (\S\ref{sec:mx}), use the \stt{ptrace} mechanism offered by most UNIX-based
operating systems.  While easy-to-use and not requiring kernel modifications,
\stt{ptrace} is slow, and these systems see performance degradations of up to
two orders of magnitude. A much faster approach is to implement the monitor in
kernel space~\cite{cox2006}, but this requires kernel patches and/or new kernel
modules, and more importantly leads to an increased trusted computing base, as
the monitor runs in privileged mode.  Furthermore, none of these approaches
scale well with the number of variants (as the monitor is both a communication
and synchronization bottleneck), none are debug-friendly (\stt{ptrace}
disallows the use of \stt{gdb}, while kernel debugging has its well-known set
of limitations) and none of them have been designed to be flexible with respect
to small variations in system call sequences (which can occur for certain
diversification transformations and across program versions).

%In this chapter, we introduce \nx, a multi-version execution framework that
%combines binary rewriting with a novel event-streaming architecture to
%significantly reduce performance overhead and scale well with the number of
%versions, without relying on intrusive kernel modifications.

In this chapter, we introduce \nx,\footnote{\varan's name comes from the
scientific name \emph{Varanus}, commonly known as the \emph{monitor} lizard.
Varan is also a name of the Kaiju monster that first appeared in the 1958 movie
\emph{Varan the Unbelievable}.} a multi-version execution system that
combines binary rewriting with a novel event-streaming architecture to
significantly reduce performance overhead and scale well with the number of
versions, without relying on intrusive kernel modifications. \nx monitor
operates at the system call level, runs in user space (and therefore in
unprivileged mode), introduces a small performance overhead for popular C10k
network servers and negligible for CPU-bound applications, scale well with the
number of versions, and provide a flexible mechanism for handling small
divergences in the system calls sequences issued across versions.
