\section{Performance evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

One of the main contributions of \nx is significantly lower
performance overhead compared to the state-of-the-art NVX systems.
Therefore, we have conducted an extensive performance evaluation,
using microbenchmarks (\S\ref{sec:microbenchmarks}), high-performance
C10k servers (\S\ref{sec:c10k}) and servers used to evaluate prior NVX
systems (\S\ref{sec:comparison}).

The microbenchmarks were run on a four-core/eight-thread machine with
a 3.50~GHz Intel Xeon~E3-1280 CPU and 16~GB RAM running 64-bit Ubuntu
14.04 LTS, while the servers were run on a pair of such machines, one
running the server under \nx and the other the client.  The machines
are located in the same rack, connected by a 1~Gb Ethernet.
