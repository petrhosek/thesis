\section{Performance evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

One of the main contributions of \varan is a significantly lower
performance overhead compared to existing state-of-the-art NVX
systems.  Therefore, we have conducted an extensive performance
evaluation, using microbenchmarks (\S\ref{sec:microbenchmarks}),
high-performance C10k servers (\S\ref{sec:c10k}) and applications used to
evaluate prior NVX systems (\S\ref{sec:comparison}).

The benchmarks were run on a four-core/eight-thread machine with
a 3.50~GHz Intel Xeon~E3-1280 CPU and 16~GB RAM running 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04
LTS. Both the server and client application on the same machine using the
loopback device to ensure that CPU is fully saturated.\marginnote{11}
%while the servers were run on a pair of such machines, one
%running the server under \varan and the other the client.  The machines are
%located in the same rack, connected by a 1~Gb Ethernet link.
