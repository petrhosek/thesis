\section{Summary}
\label{efficient-execution:summary}

Recent years have seen a growing interest in using NVX systems as a way to
increase the reliability of software systems. While NVX systems hold promise,
frameworks for implementing them efficiently have lagged behind.

In this chapter, we have presented \varan, a novel architecture for
implementing NVX monitors. \varan combines selective binary rewriting with
high-performance event streaming to deliver a flexible and efficient user-space
solution that incurs a low performance overhead, can scale to large numbers of
versions, is easier to debug than prior systems, and can handle small
divergences in the sequences of system calls issued across versions.

Our experimental evaluation has demonstrated that \varan can run C10k network
servers with low performance overhead and can be used successfully as a
multi-version execution monitor.
