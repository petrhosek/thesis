\section{Summary}
\label{multi-version:summary}

Software updates are an integral part of the software development and
maintenance process, but unfortunately they present a high risk, as new
releases often introduce new bugs and security vulnerabilities.

In this chapter, we have argued for a new way of performing software updates,
in which the new version of an application is run in parallel with old
application versions, in order to increase the reliability and security of the
overall system. We believe that multi-version software updates can have a
significant impact on current software engineering practices, by allowing
frequent software updates without sacrificing the stability and security of
older versions.
