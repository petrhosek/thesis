\section{Scope}
\label{multi-version:scope}

In this thesis, we present two different designs for building monitors suitable
for multi-version execution. The first one, called \varan described in
Chapter~\ref{chap:efficient-execution}, is aimed towards running large number
of versions side-by-side with low performance overhead, and uses selective
binary rewriting to achieve this goal. The second one, called \mx described in
Chapter~\ref{chap:safe-updates}, is focused on surviving crashes caused by bugs
introduced in software updates, with the prototype implementation built using
the \ptrace mechanism.
