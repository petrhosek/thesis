\chapter{Overview}
\label{chap:overview}

With the growing size of modern computer software systems, the number of errors
present in such systems has increased. At the same time, increasing reliance on
computers and computer software systems in every aspect of human life implies a
strong need for reliable software systems.

Software updates are an integral part of the software maintenance process, but
unfortunately present a high risk, with many users and administrators refusing
to upgrade their software and relying instead on outdated versions, which often
leaves them and their systems exposed to software bugs and security
vulnerabilities. For example, a recent survey of 50 system administrators has
reported that 70\% of respondents refrain from performing a software upgrade,
regardless of their experience level~\cite{crameri:updates}. The Hearbleed
bug~\cite{heartbleed} illustrates this behaviour. A fixed version of OpenSSL
was released on the same day the Heartbleed bug was publicly disclosed.
However, a month later, 1.5\% (12,043) of the 800,000 most popular sites in the
world were still using the vulnerable version of OpenSSL, making their servers
susceptible to attacks~\cite{heartbleed-prevalent}.

One of the main reasons for which users hesitate to install updates is that a
significant number of them result in failures. It is only too easy to find
examples of updates that fix a bug or a security vulnerability only to
introduce another problem in the code. For example, a recent study of software
updates in commercial and open-source operating systems has shown that at least
14.8\% to 25\% of fixes are incorrect and have affected end-users~\cite{yin11}.
A new bugs and security issues introduced by software updates may cause
disruption and system outages. The incident caused by the air traffic control
failure in December 2014, which disrupted hundreds of flights to and from
London airports, is a prime example.  According to the interim report published
by the official enquiry panel~\cite{natsfailure}, this incident was caused by a
system update in November 2014, which changed the number of available ``Atomic
Functions''.  Due to a latent defect, present in the system since its original
development in 1990, this update caused the failure of the entire system
following a specific action of the air traffic control, despite existing safety
mechanisms.

Another example of such disruption is the recent Verizon
outage~\cite{verizon-outage2014} of the billing and activation system,
affecting a large number of users which were unable to log into their accounts.
After the incident, Verizon issued the following statement:
\begin{quotation}
The Verizon Wireless billing system was fully restored early today, shortly
after midnight. The issue affecting some customer access to account information
was an unintended consequence of a software update performed by the company on
its billing system two days ago.
\end{quotation}
The outage, which according to reports lasted for 48 hours, was so significant 
that it generated a lot of negative reactions from frustrated customers
including its own \textsf{\#verizonfail} and \textsf{\#verizonoutage} Twitter
hashtags. This as well as other similar incidents show the possible
consequences of failed software updates.

% RBS outage~\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_RBS_Group_computer_system_problems}}

Nowadays, many services including large-scale ones such as Google, Facebook or
Amazon employ \emph{continuous deployment}, whereby new versions are
continuously released to users~\cite{johnson2009}. Multiple versions can be
released throughout the day, and A/B testing\marginnote{2} is often used to
prevent complete outage in case of an error caused by one of the versions by
making each version accessible only to a fraction of users. While this
approach helps minimise the number of users affected by newly introduced bugs,
it is not foolproof---bugs introduced by new releases may manifest themselves
only in particular cases or following prolonged operation, after a single
version has been deployed to the entire user base, as evident from past cases
affecting services such as Blogger~\cite{blogger-incident2011} or
Facebook~\cite{facebook-incident2010}. Failures and outages affecting the
majority of the user-base therefore occur even in these applications. Such
outages might cause significant financial losses and frustration among users,
and it is therefore critical to avoid them.

Our goal is to improve the software update process in such a way as to
encourage users to upgrade to the latest software version, without sacrificing
the stability or availability of the older version, by taking advantage of the
idle resources made available by multi-core platforms.

%The problems caused by failed software updates are not restricted to services.
%\lighttpd,\footnote{\url{http://www.lighttpd.net/}} a popular web server used
%by numerous popular websites such as xkcd,\footnote{\url{http://xkcd.com/}}
%introduced a bug while trying to fix another bug in the implementation of HTTP
%ETags functionality, which caused the server to crash on some configurations.
%This bug remained undetected for nine months, despite affecting a number of
%users, and it took another three months to diagnose and fix the underlying
%issue.\footnote{\url{http://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2169}}

%Desktop applications are affected by failed software updates as well.
%\vim,\footnote{\url{http://www.vim.org/}} arguably one of the most popular text
%editors, shipped with the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution, has been also
%affected by failed software updates in the past. In version 7.1.127, while
%trying to fix a memory leak, \vim developers introduced a double \lstinline`free`
%bug that caused \vim to crash whenever the user tried to use a path completion
%feature.  This bug made its way into Ubuntu 8.04, affecting a large number of
%users.\footnote{\url{https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vim/+bug/219546}}
