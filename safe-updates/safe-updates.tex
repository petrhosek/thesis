\chapter{Multi-version Software Updates}
\label{chap:safe-updates}

% Software updates are an integral part of the software maintenance
% process, with new software versions being released on a continuous
% basis.  Unfortunately, software updates often result in failures,
% which makes many users reluctant to incorporate the latest patches
% made available by developers.  As a result, users rely instead on
% outdated versions, which despite their relative stability, miss recent
% features and bug fixes and may be plagued by security vulnerabilities.

% One of the main reasons for which users hesitate to install updates is
% that a significant number of them result in failures.  It is only too
% easy to find examples of updates that fix a bug or a security
% vulnerability only to introduce another problem in 
% the code. Our goal is to improve the software update
% process in such a way as to encourage users to upgrade to the latest
% software version, without sacrificing the stability of the older
% version.

Multi-version execution can be used to improve the reliability of updated
software by running multiple different versions (revisions) in parallel,
discarding one (or more) versions in case of failure. The potential problem of
such approach is that we might eventually run out versions given multiple crash
bugs located at different points across versions. We tackle this problem by
combining multi-version execution with a failure recovery mechanism, introduced
in Section~\ref{multi-version:rationale}, which takes advantage of the
similarity between consecutive software versions.

% We tackle this problem using a simple but effective multi-version
% based approach.  Whenever a new update becomes available, instead of
% upgrading the software to the new version, we run the new version in
% parallel with the old one; by carefully coordinating their executions
% and selecting the behaviour of the more reliable version when they
% diverge, we create a more secure and dependable multi-version
% application.

We implemented this approach in a prototype system called \mx, which
targets crash bugs in Linux applications.
\mx allows a new and an old version of an application to
run concurrently, without requiring any
modifications to the application itself or the operating system, nor any
input from the user. To achieve this goal, \mx combines static and
dynamic techniques: it uses static analysis at the binary-level to
construct mappings between the old and the new versions, and synchronises the
execution of the two versions at the system call level, using system call
interposition and synchronisation.  When one of the versions crashes, \mx
transparently restarts it via a lightweight checkpointing mechanism and often
allows it to survive the bug by using the code of the other version.

% We evaluate \mx by showing that it can successfully survive crashes in
% several real applications, specifically several \coreutils utilities and
% two popular servers, \lighttpd and \redis.

%Software systems are constantly evolving, with new versions and
%patches being released on a continuous basis.  Unfortunately, software
%updates present a high risk, with many releases introducing new bugs
%and security vulnerabilities.
