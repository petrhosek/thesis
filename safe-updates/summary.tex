\section{Summary}
\label{safe-updates:summary}

Software updates are an important part of the software development and
maintenance process. Unfortunately, they also present a high failure risk, and
many users refuse to upgrade their software, relying instead on outdated
versions, which often leave them exposed to known software bugs and security
vulnerabilities.

In this chapter, we have presented \mx, a multi-version execution system for
improving the software update process. Whenever a new program update becomes
available, instead of upgrading the software to the newest version, we run the
new version in parallel with the old one, and carefully synchronise their
execution to create a more secure and reliable multi-version application.

\mx supports off-the-shelf Linux applications and our evaluation has shown that
it can be applied successfully to several real applications such as
\gnu~\coreutils, \lighttpd, and \redis.
